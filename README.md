## To live in the Digital Age

To rummage for solace. To fumble for your phone in your pocket, to find it, to feel relief. To wrap your fingers around its edges, to hug it tightly within your palm. To go for a walk outside. To see someone approaching, to lower your gaze, to pull out your phone, to check the time. To hear a chime and feel a buzz. To smile at the familiar glow. To unlock the box with a swift fingerprint. To walk with both hands in your pockets, hoodie rolled up. To watch the streetlamps, turn on at night. To tilt your head up at the sky. To feel small. To point your camera up to the stars, to flash a picture. To feel cold. To warm up your hands with the heat of your phone. 

To crave a snack. To rip open a packet of Maggi Noodles. To gaze deeply into the rotating microwave plate. To eat at an empty table. To pull open a podcast on your phone. To listen to somebody, speak to an audience you cannot see. To imagine sitting next to somebody. To laugh alone. To share the last bite of noodles with yourself. To take a sip of cold water. To panic when your phone threatens to die, to frantically scramble for a charger, to jam the charger into your phone socket. To watch the screen brighten just slightly, to indicate that it is charging. To slump back into your seat, relieved. To sit with both elbows on the table and chin resting in both hands. To wait for your phone to charge back up. 

To sing to the world from your bedroom window. To mindlessly scroll through apps and trending hashtags. To blink too many times. To skip a heartbeat when a notification pops up. To put your phone down. To look up at the ceiling. To reminisce the day. To pick up your phone, again. To check the weather for tomorrow. To check if your alarms have been set. To check over your calendar. To close all remaining open apps. To close your phone, again. To close your own eyes.

## PARODY ON THE PEOPLE’S PERCEPTION OF PRIVACY
![image](chosen_meme.jpg)

Open your goddamn eyes, turn your head towards the plate and smell the fucking pancakes. You want the pancakes, damnit. Screw the diet. You knew you couldn’t resist forever. What did you expect? It was only a matter of time and they all knew you’d revert eventually. Don’t worry so much, they all do it too. It’s human nature. Just don’t eat it and expect it to be any different from the one hundred other times you ate it. You know what they say – can’t have your cake and eat it too – you’re breaking your fucking diet and that’s that. But what’s the point of having a fucking diet if you’re not going to break it? There are some things that just can’t exist without their own inexistence. Like laws. Or privacy. 

You want to eat the pancakes because you’re hungry and you’re hungry because you’re on a fucking diet. That’s why they created this diner right next to a gym. Did they do anything wrong by creating it here? They knew some sucker like you would see the sign and walk in. We’re all suckers though, nothing new about that. Are they monsters for luring you in with the sweet, sticky smell of maple syrup, and the crisp, warm fragrance of freshly flipped pancakes? What the fuck do you expect from them? It makes no fucking sense to call them monsters for giving you what you want. If they weren’t doing their job, you wouldn’t be here. And if you weren’t here, they wouldn’t exist. Don’t pin this on them. Blame your own fucking inability to control yourself. Fucking punk-ass finger pointer.

You didn’t even know you wanted pancakes until you came here. They knew you wanted pancakes and they just made it so fucking easy for you to get them. Come on, buy one. Buy a pancake. Buy a stack, you’ll get a better deal. Might as well get the combo with the drink if you want to get the best bang for your buck. What? They’re not forcing you to do anything. They’re just presenting you with the menu. How the fuck would you know what to order if they didn’t give you a menu? You’re a fucking hypocrite if you’re going to moan and whine about them setting up shop when you’re the one fucking ordering off their menu and keeping them running in the first place. 

Yeah, give them your money. 

And don’t forget that they’re open Mondays – Saturdays, from 8AM – 3PM.

## The Digital Line

Have you ever watched a steam train leave its station? She slowly groans and grubs against the rails, churning her large, mechanical legs with increasing fervor. Each wooden nibble ignites her further. She releases a loud, airy chuckle as she races down the platform, holding her passengers captive.  

Have you yet boarded the digital train? She arrived in the early 2000s and has really been building traction. You will know once you have boarded; the fare is quite high. Unfortunately, it seems to come at the cost of your life. See, once you board the digital train, there is only one direction left to travel, and that is along the contours of the tracks that the train has been set to follow. Data hungry train. But don’t worry so much, you are not the only person boarding the train. We are all contained, together! The government, our conductor, will help direct us along these capitalist contours, so thoughtfully mapped by such pretty ~oh, pretty!~ advertisements and mesmerizing entertainment devices. Be careful, now, once she admits you she will keep you until she exhausts you of all your information, and then she will toss you out with a hearty laugh right from the nose of her horn. Until then, though, just try to enjoy the ride.

Do you have motion sickness? It isn’t uncommon. She might try to sell you some of that mind-numbing, pill tea to distract you from the nausea that she creates. Very smart of her, see, because you might think the tea is free, but really, she’s just nibbled a little bit of your identity (yes, this is synonymous to ~privacy~). Little nibbles here and there. Keep the train car just cold enough so that you ask for the heater to be turned on, and while you think the heating is free, she dips one titanium arm into the front pocket of your mind– patting your shoulder with her other – as she thanks you for choosing her for your journey today. Hah. Don’t be fooled by her comradery, she can just as easily turn scary. When you’ve been riding for so long, it becomes easy to forget just how menacing she looks.

How are you enjoying the ride so far? Have you tipped her with your social security number yet? She loves that. Toss in a couple bits and coins! Why try to keep it all to yourself when you can share it?!  You’re going to be here for a while as it is…

So, yeah. Welcome to the Digital Express, where the food is wonderful and the service is absolutely mind-blowing (and that’s because she can literally predict what you want before you know you want it)!


To those who wander the web:

Be wary. You tread dangerously close between waters of sovereignty and complete subservience. The tools of the internet are here not to abet you, not to impart within you the knowledge of the universe, but to study you, and to document the movements of your mind.

How much do you know yourself? Do you ever reflect upon your own patterns of thought? Can you categorize your behavior according to time of day, day of week, season of year? Can you tell me what you want, this instant? If you do not have answers, do not worry. Let me introduce you to someone who can fill you in. Here she is in all her glory, a digital canvas. She is here to divulge with you, your greatest insecurities, your innermost desires, your passions and whims, and your darkest dreams. She knows your history down to the milliseconds of your clicks. She creates your future with the content she displays before you. Be wary, dear friend.

When you close your eyes at night, there she watches, with bright electricity pulsating through the fibers of her motherboard. Big, digital tentacles sprout from her body and spring themselves deep into your brain, probing at your conscious and sucking away your ability to think independently. By the time you wake up, she has reprogrammed you to her liking. Do you want to become another computerized cog? Another mechanical man? I urge you to fight the hive mind. Be wary of the internet, my friend. Be wary of her arrival. Be wary of your life.
